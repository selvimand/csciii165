<p>Canada has some truly wonderful man-made attractions, but
 nothing can match the raw beauty of our country's natural
 wonders. These sights will take your breath awayâ€”and stay with
  you for the rest of your life.</p>
  <p>Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the
  southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between
the province of Ontario in Canada and New York state in the
United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls
, also known as Canadian Falls, which straddles the international
border of the two countries.</p>
